<h1 align="center"> Recommender systems for Amazon products </h1> <br>

## Introduction

Almost everything we buy or consume today is influenced y some form of recommendation, whether that's from friends, family, external reviews and more recently from the sources selling you the product. For exemple, Amazon recommends items to you as you browse for a particular product. It shows you similar products from a competing source and suggets auxiliarity items frequently bought together with the product.<p>
In this project, we will build recommendation systems for Amazon's Health and Personal Care products using [Amazon datasets source](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) using Python. Recommender systems are pretty self-explanatory, as the name suggets, they are systems or techniques that recommend or sugget a particular product, service, or entity. <p>
In this case, we will use two of the most popular types of recommender systems : <p>
  
  ## Item-based filtering
  
 If a group of people have made similar reviews for two items, then the two items must be similar. Therefore, if a person likes one particular item, they're likely to be interested in the other item too. <p>

## User-based filtering 

The main idea behind user-based filtering is that if we are able to find users that have baught and liked similar items in the past, they are more likely to buy similar items in the future too. Therefore, these models recommend items to a user that similar users have also liked.<p>
